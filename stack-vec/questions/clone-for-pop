StackVec use a slice `storage` to store all the elements. 
According to the documents, elements stored in arrays cannot be moved out anyway.
Usually, `storage` is a slice derived from a array.
But I am not sure about other types which can be used as `storage`.
Concerning index access, I did try `Vec`. When I try to move value of it, the compiler complains "cannot move out of indexed content".
